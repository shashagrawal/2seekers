# What is Jekyll
#### Jekyll is a popular `static website generator` that allows developers to create simple, fast-loading websites without the need for a database or server-side scripting. It was created by `Tom Preston-Werner`, co-founder of `GitHub`, and released in `2008` as an open-source project.

Static websites generated by Jekyll consist of `HTML, CSS, and JavaScript` files that can be served directly to a web browser without the need for server-side processing. This results in faster loading times and reduced server load compared to dynamic websites that require server-side processing and database access.

Jekyll uses the `Liquid` templating language, which allows developers to create dynamic content using `variables, filters, and loops`. Jekyll also supports `Markdown`, a lightweight markup language that allows developers to write content in a simple and readable format.

Jekyll is often used by developers who want to create simple websites, `blogs`, or portfolios without the need for complex content management systems or server-side programming. It is also popular among developers who use `GitHub Pages`, a free service that allows developers to host their Jekyll-generated websites directly from their GitHub repositories.

> Overall, Jekyll is a simple, lightweight, and powerful tool that enables developers to create fast-loading, easy-to-maintain websites without the need for complex server-side infrastructure.

# Example of Websites already using Jekyll

#### Here are a few examples of websites that are built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages along with some details of the important features related to blogging

- **Sass Blog** - This is a simple blog built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and it includes a commenting system powered by Disqus, as well as social media sharing buttons for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

- **The Changelog** - The Changelog is a popular technology podcast and blog that is built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It includes a commenting system powered by Discourse, a powerful open-source discussion platform, as well as a newsletter sign-up form that collects email addresses.

- **O'Reilly Media** - O'Reilly Media is a well-known publisher of technology books and resources, and their website is built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It includes a commenting system powered by Disqus, as well as social media sharing buttons and related post suggestions.


> All of these websites are good examples of what can be achieved with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and they demonstrate how to incorporate features such as commenting systems, email collection forms, social media sharing buttons, and related post suggestions. Keep in mind that these websites are likely built by professional web developers, so they may be more complex than what you can achieve with basic Jekyll knowledge. Nonetheless, they serve as great sources of inspiration and ideas for creating your own Jekyll-powered website.

# Additional blog related worthy features

- **Sass Blog:** In addition to the commenting system and social media sharing buttons, Sass Blog includes an email subscription form powered by Mailchimp, as well as a search bar that allows users to search for specific blog posts.

- **The Changelog:** The Changelog includes a robust tagging system that allows users to filter blog posts by topic or technology, as well as a live chat feature powered by Gitter that allows users to chat with the site's creators in real-time.

- **Smashing Magazine:** In addition to the commenting system and related post suggestions, Smashing Magazine includes a job board where users can search for and apply to web design and development jobs, as well as a store where users can purchase books, courses, and other resources.

- **O'Reilly Media:** In addition to the commenting system and related post suggestions, O'Reilly Media includes a video library where users can watch on-demand courses and conference talks, as well as a shop where users can purchase books, ebooks, and other resources.


> Overall, these websites demonstrate how Jekyll and GitHub Pages can be used to create complex, feature-rich websites that go beyond simple blogging sites. While not all of these features may be necessary or relevant to your specific use case, they can serve as inspiration for what is possible with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

# Free & Paid plugins that may be needed

- **Disqus:** Disqus is a free commenting system that is used on many Jekyll-powered websites, including some of the sites I mentioned. Disqus also offers paid plans that provide additional features such as advanced moderation tools and audience insights.

- **Mailchimp:** Mailchimp is a popular email marketing platform that is used by many Jekyll-powered websites. While Mailchimp offers a free plan that supports basic email marketing features, more advanced features such as email automation and A/B testing require a paid plan.

- **Gitter:** Gitter is a chat platform that is used by The Changelog for its live chat feature. Gitter offers a free plan that includes basic chat features, but more advanced features such as file sharing and integrations require a paid plan.

- **Discourse:** Discourse is a powerful open-source discussion platform that is used by some Jekyll-powered websites, including The Changelog. While Discourse is free to use and can be self-hosted, there are also paid options that offer additional features such as hosting and support.

- **Shopify:** Shopify is an e-commerce platform that is used by some Jekyll-powered websites, including Smashing Magazine and O'Reilly Media. Shopify offers a variety of plans with different pricing levels depending on the size and needs of your online store.


> It's worth noting that while these paid plugins can add additional functionality and features to your Jekyll-powered website, there are also many free and open-source alternatives available. For example, instead of using Mailchimp for email collection, you could use a free and open-source alternative such as Formspree or Netlify Forms. Instead of using Shopify for e-commerce, you could use a free and open-source platform such as WooCommerce or Snipcart. Ultimately, the choice of which plugins to use will depend on your specific needs and budget.

# Mailchimp v/s Mailerlite comparison

#### Both Mailchimp and MailerLite are popular email marketing platforms that offer a range of features for businesses and organizations. Here are some of the key differences between the two:

- **Pricing:** Mailchimp and MailerLite both offer free plans that include basic email marketing features, but MailerLite's free plan allows for more subscribers and emails per month than Mailchimp's. Mailchimp's paid plans can be more expensive than MailerLite's, particularly for larger lists.

- **Features:** Both platforms offer similar features such as email templates, automation, and reporting, but there are some differences. For example, Mailchimp offers more advanced segmentation options and A/B testing, while MailerLite offers a built-in landing page builder and integrations with popular e-commerce platforms.

- **Ease of use:** Both platforms are designed to be user-friendly and offer drag-and-drop email editors, but some users may find one platform easier to use than the other depending on their preferences and experience.


> Overall, both Mailchimp and MailerLite are good options for businesses and organizations looking to start or improve their email marketing efforts. Choosing between the two will depend on factors such as your budget, list size, and specific feature needs. It may be worth trying out both platforms to see which one works best for your organization.
